===========
it is a *packet anaylsis* tool but with goal of providing you **information about users** instead of packet.
Right now we have too many things in wish list than in feature list

# Requirment
> tshark for reading packet

We are open for suggestion or feedback or any comment or help

# How it works 
Give it capture file which tshark can read and it will give you information about different users using and that network and what they are doing.
